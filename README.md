# PHP-Recursive-Example
This is an PHP recursive example which simply used the directory structure and list all folders and files in it.

In this snippet i have used <a href="https://www.jstree.com" target="_blank">JS Tree</a> library for its GUI.
And jQuery version used in this example is version 1.12.1.

All style sheets and script used in this snipped are CDN based, so just deploy the php file on your localserver and run from your browser.

This Repository contains the dummy tree structure zip folder which contains the dummy folders and files in it.
Just extract the folder in any drive and add change the path in recursive_example.php file where it says $folderPath = "DriveName:/FolderName";

After changing the path run the file from your local server like xampp,wamp etc.
